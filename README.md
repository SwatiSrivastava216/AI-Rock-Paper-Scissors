# AI-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Experimenting with Deep Learning and Image Classification with the aim of building a simple yet fun iteration of the infamous Rock Paper Scissors game.

#### It consists of 5 major steps:
1. Collecting an image dataset
2. Select/Design a neural network
3. Training
4. Testing the model
5. Creating an interactive application

#### Libraries Used
1. Keras-Preprocessing: Keras Preprocessing is the data preprocessing and data augmentation module of the Keras deep learning library.
2. Keras-squeezenet: SqueezeNet is a convolutional neural network that employs design strategies to reduce the number of parameters.
3. OpenCV: OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks.
